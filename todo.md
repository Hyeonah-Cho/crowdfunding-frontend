  - [ ] Snap scroll.. I can't apply this one to Layout as it should only be applied HomePage but I don't like having two scroll bars in Home.. hang on.. is this the same on other pages regardless of having snap scroll? hmm what if I remove the Layout scroll on Home page? is it even possible? I can't remove the scrollbar on Home as the random snap behaviour will confuse users. I think a lot of other websites would have the same feature i.e. snap scroll only on Home page. How to they handle this issue?
